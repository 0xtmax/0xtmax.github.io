Deploying applications manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. As developers, we need a system that ensures our applications are built, tested, and deployed quickly and reliably‚Äîthat's where CI/CD comes in.

In this blog, we will talk through the process of creating a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub, AWS CodePipeline, AWS Code Build and Amazon S3. By the end, you will have a seamless deployment process for your react application. In the next post, i will automate this process with Terraform. 

# What is CI/CD?

![image.png](/assets/cicd/image.png)

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery:

- Continuous Integration: Automatically builds and tests your code every time you make a change.
- Continuous Delivery: Automatically deploys the tested code to production or staging environments.

This approach eliminates human error and speeds up software delivery, making your development lifecycle smoother and more efficient.

## Architecture Overview

Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre building:

- **GitHub**: Stores your React app Code.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Manages the flow from source to deployment.
- **AWS Code Build**: Compiles and testes your React app.
- **Amazon S3:** Hosts the final deployed application (Static website)

### Step-by-Step CI/CD Pipeline Setup

**Step 1: Push Your React App to Github**

Create a simple React app (e.g., a SaaS landing page). Commit and push it to a Github repository.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

**Step2: Setup a IAM for this Pipeline**

Always avoid using the AWS root user and creating the least privilage IAM users/ Role based IAM users is the best practice. Lets create a new IAM user with permision to manage:

- **Amazon S3**
- **AWS CodePipeline**
- **Code Build**
- **Code Commit**
- **Code Deploy**
- **Manage GitHub requests and authentication**

1. Create a Custom Policy
    - Login to the AWS Management Console using your **root user**.
    - Go to IAM ‚Üí Policies ‚Üí Create Policies
    - Click the JSON tab
    - Paste  this policy:  Not the secure version, Only for the **Test Environment** üòâ
        
        ```json
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Sid": "S3FullAccess",
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": "s3:*",
                    "Resource": "*"
                },
                {

                    ],
                    "Resource": "*"

                },
                {

                        "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
                        "ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces",
                        "ec2:CreateNetworkInterface",
                        "ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface"
                    ],
                    "Resource": "*"
                },
                {
                    "Sid": "CloudFormationAccess",
                    "Effect": "Allow",

                        "cloudformation:DeleteStack",
                        "cloudformation:GetTemplate",
                        "cloudformation:ListStacks"
                    ],
                    "Resource": "*"
                },
                {
                    "Sid": "CodeCommitFullAccess",
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": [
                        "codecommit:*"
                    ],
                    "Resource": "*"
                },
                {
                    "Sid": "EventsAndSNS",

                    "Action": [
                        "events:*",
                        "sns:*"
                    ],
                    "Resource": "*"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
        
    
    Reviewing the policy above, I don't recommend using it in production environments. We're creating this for testing purposes only. The policy grants full access permissions to many AWS services, which is acceptable during development but risky for production due to potential security, compliance, and operational issues.
    

**What Security issues we have here if we done this on a production environment?**

1. **Overly Permissive (Wildcards )**:
    - `Action: *` and `Resource: *` allow **any action on all resources**, which is **very dangerous** if this IAM user or role gets compromised.
2. **Privilege Escalation Risk**:
    - Granting full `iam:*` or broad `iam:PassRole` rights can allow users to escalate privileges by attaching roles/policies.
3. **CloudTrail Gaps**:
    - Difficult to audit specific access without restrictive policies.
4. **Lateral Movement Risk**:
    - An attacker who gains access to this IAM user can move across many services and regions.
5. **Incompatible with Least Privilege Principle**:
    - Violates AWS's security best practices by not limiting access only to what‚Äôs needed.

**How to improve for the production - Best Practices?**

1. **Use Least Privilege Principle**

    - Only allow **exact actions** your pipeline requires.
    - Replace:
        
        ```json
    
        "Action": "s3:*"
        
        ```
        
        with:
        
        ```json
        
        "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
        ]
        
        ```
    

2. **Restrict Resource Access**

    - Replace `"Resource": "*"` with the **ARNs** of specific buckets, pipelines, roles, etc.
    
    ```json
    
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-app-bucket/*"
    
    ```
    

3. **Limit IAM Permissions**

    - Only allow specific roles to be passed:
    
    ```json
    
    "Action": "iam:PassRole",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyCodeBuildServiceRole"
    
    ```
    

4. **Use Condition Keys**

    - Use `Condition` to limit usage by service, time, IP, etc.
    
    ```json
   
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "aws:RequestedRegion": "us-east-1"
      }
    }
    
    ```
    

5. **Split by Use Case (Granular Roles)**

    - Create **separate IAM roles** for:
        - CodeBuild
        - CodePipeline
        - Deployment
    - Assign only required permissions to each.

6. **Enable CloudTrail + GuardDuty**

    - Use these for logging and anomaly detection.
    - Set up alerts for `iam:PassRole`, `CreatePolicy`, etc.

### Scoped S3 Access Policy in the production

    ```json
    {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
    ],
    "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-app-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-app-bucket/*"
    ]
    }
    ```

**üîÅ Recommended Best Practices:**

1. Create separate IAM roles for each service (CodeBuild, CodePipeline, etc.).
2. Start with AWS managed policies (`AWSCodeBuildDeveloperAccess`, `AWSCodePipelineFullAccess`) as templates, then restrict permissions     further.
3. Verify least privilege implementation using **AWS Access Analyzer** or **IAM Access Advisor**.

- Name the policy as `DevTeam-S3-CodePipeline-Access`.
- Create the policy

    -  Create IAM Group: `dev-team`
        - Go to User groups ‚Üí Create group
        - Group name: `dev-team`
        - In the Permissions step, search for  `DevTeam-S3-CodePipeline-Access`
        - Select it and proceed
        - Create the group
    -  Create IAM User `tj`
        - Go to **IAM ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Add users**
        - **User name:** `tj`
        - **Access type:**
            - ‚úÖ Programmatic access (for CLI)
            - ‚úÖ AWS Management Console access
        - Set a custom password
            - Click **Next: Add user to group**
            - Select **Group:** `dev-team`
            - Skip tags and review
            - Click **Create user**

**Step 3: Create a CodePipeline using GitHub + CodeBuild and S3**

Ensure you are in the same region (e.g., us-east-1).

1. **Create an S3 Bucket for Hosting**
    - Go to S3 Service ‚Üí Create Bucket
    - Bucket name: cybersense-aws-b-demo
    - Leave everything as default for now and scroll down ‚Üí Click Create Bucket.
2. **Create CodePipeline**
    
    CodePipeline is Amazon‚Äôs solution for continuous delivery.
    
    1. Search ‚ÄúCode Pipeline‚Äù from the search and Click Create Pipeline.
    2. Select ‚ÄúBuild Custom Pipeline.‚Äù
        
        ![image.png](/assets/cicd/image%202.png)
        
    3. Pipeline name: aws-codepipline-react-app-demo
        
        ![image.png](/assets/cicd/image%203.png)
        
    4. Leave the role as ‚ÄúNew service role‚Äù and click next.
    5. **Source Stage:**
        - Source Provider: GitHub
        - Connect via GitHub App
        - Name the connection as ‚Äúcicd-connection-demo‚Äù
        - Click Connect to GitHub and install new app.
        - In the GitHub account, choose only select repositories and select the project repository.
        - After the connection is established, choose the Repository name and Default Branch.
        - Click Next.
    6. **Create CodeBuild Project**
        - Choose the Build Provider as ‚ÄúOther build providers‚Äù and select AWS CodeBuild.
        - Click ‚Üí Create Project.
        - Project name: aws-cicd-pipeline-demo-build
        - In the environment:
            - Provisioning mode: On demand
            - Environment image: Managed Image
            - Compute: EC2
            - Running Mode: Container
            - Operating system: Amazon Linux
            - Runtime: Standard
        - Configure Buildspec:
            - Select ‚ÄúUse a buildspec file‚Äù
            - Go to your project directory in VSCode and create a file named `buildspec.yml`.
            - Paste the following code:
                
                ```yaml
                version: 0.2
                
                phases:
                  install:
                    runtime-versions:
                      nodejs: 18
                    commands:
                      - echo Installing dependencies...
                      - npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
                
                  build:
                    commands:
                      - echo Building the React app...
                      - npm run build
                
                artifacts:

## Conclusion
        
In this walkthrough, we established a secure, structured approach that allows developers to manage specific AWS services without exposing the root user or granting excessive permissions. Here's what we achieved:
        
- ‚úÖ Created a dedicated **IAM user (`tj`)** to avoid using the AWS root account for routine tasks.
- ‚úÖ Built an **IAM group (`dev-team`)** and attached a **custom least-privilege policy** that grants access only to:
     - Amazon S3
     - AWS CodePipeline
     - AWS CodeBuild
     - AWS CodeCommit
     - AWS CodeConnections (with OAuth access permissions)
 - ‚úÖ Attached the policy to the group for reuse with future users.
 - ‚úÖ Verified access and tested permissions to ensure users can authenticate with third-party services (e.g., GitHub) using **OAuth** and build pipelines.
        
 By implementing this **least privilege** principle, you now have a secure environment where developers can work independently within defined boundaries‚Äîminimizing risk while maximizing productivity.
