In todayâ€™s digital landscape, maintaining a secure IT environment is paramount for organizations of all sizes. Windows Event Logs serve as a critical source of information for detecting, investigating, and responding to security incidents. These logs provide detailed insights into activities occurring within your systems, helping security teams identify anomalies, unauthorized access, and potential threats.

Monitoring specific Windows Event IDs is an effective way to streamline your security operations. By focusing on key events such as failed login attempts, account changes, privileged account usage, and unusual network connections, you can enhance your ability to detect and respond to malicious activities before they escalate.

This blog highlights a curated list of essential Windows Event IDs that every security team should monitor. From user logon patterns to registry changes, file access, and network activity, these events provide a comprehensive overview of activities that could indicate a security breach or policy violation. Whether you're setting up a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system or manually reviewing logs, this guide will help you prioritize what to watch for, ensuring you stay ahead of potential threats.

Dive in to explore these critical event IDs, understand their significance, and learn how to leverage them for robust security monitoring.
